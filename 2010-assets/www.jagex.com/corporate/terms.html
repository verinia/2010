<b>
Introduction</b><br/>
This website is owned and operated by Jagex Limited ("Jagex"), a company registered in England and Wales (registered number 3982706). Our registered office is at St John's Innovation Centre, Cowley Road, Cambridge, CB4 0WS, United Kingdom. Our VAT number is 791 951 784.</p>
<p>
<b>
Definitions</b><br/>
"Jagex Product(s)" is used as shorthand for all versions of "RuneScape®", "FunOrb®" and any other of our online games including all Jagex websites used to play those games.</p>
<p>References to "stopping" an account include all or any of: locking, temporarily or permanently banning, or temporarily or permanently muting the account. If your account is muted, you can continue to play but will not be able to use free text chat. If your account is banned, you will not be able to access your account at all. NB Membership credit continues to expire if accounts are muted or banned.</p>
<p>
<b>
Applicability</b><br/>
Please read these terms and conditions carefully. Your accepting them in full is a condition of your use of a Jagex product (whether or not you subscribe). If you don't agree with any part, please don't accept them or use the Jagex product.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about these terms and conditions, please contact us via email at <img style="vertical-align: bottom; display: inline;" src="../img/privacy/lawcontact.gif" alt=""/> and do not use the site until you are satisfied with and can accept these terms and conditions in full.</p>
<p>
<b>
Changes</b><br/>
We may change these terms and conditions to reflect: changes in applicable laws; regulatory or security requirements; relevant guidance or codes of practice; technical alterations to Jagex Products; and to improve clarity and consistency. Please check the terms and conditions whenever you use a Jagex Product. If you are not a subscriber, we will treat your continued use of a Jagex Product as acceptance of these changes from their effective date as shown above. If you are a subscriber, we will treat you as bound by the changes on the first renewal date for your subscription after the effective date and so you should cancel your subscription (as explained below) before this renewal date if you don't like the proposed changes.</p>
<p>
<b>
A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT PRETEENS AND USERS UNDER 18</b><br/>
If you are under 13 you will be able to create an account but unable to disclose personal data through the game or website. If we find out that any personal data we have collected is from someone under 13, we will automatically delete it. We recommend that parents / guardians set up an account and play together with their children. Many parents have reported that playing Jagex Products as a family is fun and rewarding.</p>
<p>If you are under 13 and subscribe to the members' version of our game you are representing (i.e. making a promise) that you have consent from your parents / guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our terms and conditions and <a href="privacy.html">privacy policy</a>. We may stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given.</p>
<p>If you are under 18, by using our website you are representing (i.e. making a promise) that you have consent from your parents / guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our terms and conditions and <a href="privacy.html">privacy policy</a>. We may stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given.</p>
<p>If we are told by a parent / guardian that their child has lied about their age when registering for Jagex Products, we will stop the account provided we have information which satisfies us that the reporting person is indeed the parent or guardian.</p>
<p>Parents can find more information about the game and how to contact us in the <a href="../l%3d0/corporate/Parents_Guide/parents_guide.html" target="_blank">Parents' Guide</a>.</p>
<p>

Safety / abuse</b><br/>

It is particularly important to read the <a href="../../www.runescape.com/kbase/guid/play_safely.html">Play Safely Guide</a> and the
<a href="../../www.runescape.com/kbase/guid/health_amp_safety.html">Health &amp; Safety Guide</a>.

<p>Whilst we reserve the right to monitor and take action if any Jagex Product is used inappropriately (including the posting of objectionable material on the chat facility or otherwise), we cannot promise that any Jagex Product won't contain such content or that we will remove / modify any particular content. Nor can we guarantee that users will comply with our terms and conditions or otherwise behave appropriately.</p>
<p>If you are the victim of offensive or inappropriate behaviour or receive any other unwanted communications, you should use the built-in facilities to block the messages. (See <a href="../../www.runescape.com/kbase/guid/controls_friends.html">this article</a> for guidance on blocking messages.) You should report all inappropriate behaviour to us via the in game <a href="../../www.runescape.com/kbase/guid/how_do_i_report_abuse.html">"Report abuse"</a> button as well as seeking appropriate external help, for example from parents or law enforcement authorities.
