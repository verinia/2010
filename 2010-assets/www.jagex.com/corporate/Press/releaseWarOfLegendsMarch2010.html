<br/>
<br/>
<i>War of Legends emerges as a leading real-time strategy game as hundreds of thousands join the battle</i></p>
<p><b>Cambridge, UK&mdash;18<sup>th</sup> March 2010</b> &mdash; Jagex Games Studio, the UK's largest independent games company, today announced that its first third-party publishing title War of Legends has achieved rapid acceleration in popularity during the game's beta phase, which launched in January 2010. With hundreds of thousands of players already joining the battle, War of Legends has already significantly changed the landscape of real-time strategy gaming.</p>
<p>"It is great to see so many players flock to War of Legends so soon after its launch and it is especially encouraging to see entire alliances independently migrate from other RTS games to War of Legends," said Mark Gerhard, CEO at Jagex Games Studio. "Jagex has a long standing reputation for offering unparalleled browser-based game play, and War of Legends is no exception to this commitment. With the game's extensive content, high quality graphics and ease of levelling it is clear to see why so many players have been enticed to the game and we are confident that as the game evolves War of Legends will cement its position as the must play RTS game."</p>
<p>War of Legends is a flash-based RTS game based on ancient Chinese mythology, which immerses players in a world where they can build vast empires, appoint legendary leaders and form multi-player alliances to reach eternal glory. This rich back-story is a drastic contrast to traditional RTS games that typically have very fragmented or non-existent storylines. The development quality far exceeds that of similar titles currently in the market, and parallels Jagex's high standard for game excellence, depth of content, graphics and community support.</p>
<p>"The response from the War of Legends community has been overwhelmingly positive," said Mark Gregson, War of Legends' Community Manager at Jagex. "Players are really enjoying the depth of game play, which is missing from other browser-based RTS games, and our reputation for integrity, community support and high quality gaming has positioned War of Legends as the leading free to play RTS. It has been fascinating to watch as players build up their cities, create alliances and command their armies into battle. Our dedicated community team are planning an ongoing series of in-game events to challenge and test our players and we can't wait to welcome more players as they join the War of Legends community."</p>
<p>War of Legends is available to play for free by visiting <a href="http://www.waroflegends.com/">www.waroflegends.com</a>.</p>
