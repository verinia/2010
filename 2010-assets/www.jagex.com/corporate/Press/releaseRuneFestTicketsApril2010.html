Those who have pre-registered for tickets will enjoy a 24-hour exclusive ticket office opening to everyone else on Saturday 1st May 2010 at 10am.</p>

<p>Jagex CEO, Mark Gerhard, said, <q>We have been overwhelmed so far by the level of interest and pre-registrations for this event and we expect that we will sell out of tickets in no time. I really urge all players wanting to come to our amazing event to get pre-registered in order to secure their tickets. We want to make sure everyone who wants to attend can and here at Jagex we are all very excited about meeting our marvellous player community.</q></p>
<p>The event will fire up RuneScape fans from around the globe as the world of RuneScape will be brought to life in various forms, including themed areas with interactivity for players to experience real world activities such as live role playing, ogre wrestling and archery skills. The venue will also play host to dedicated clan areas, food and drink venues and many interactive games and amusements, making the day one to remember.</p>
<p>Players will also be privy to an exclusive gameplay experience onsite that will be like nothing experienced before or outside the RuneFest 2010 walls.</p>
<p>RuneFest 2010 will allow all attendees to be fully immersed into the RuneFest experience with involvement in all areas of the event, from live events and competitions offering players the opportunity to speak directly to each other and the Jagex team in the Insider sessions and Golden Gnome winners video work being displayed.</p>
<p>Jagex is holding the event as a reward and 'thank you' to the millions of dedicated RuneScape players around the world and as a way of interacting with thousands of them in person. Attendees will have a full and fun-packed day like none other.</p>
<p>The lead developer and co-founder of Jagex Games Studio, Andrew Gower, said, <q>We've got pretty good at doing massive parties for our staff, with each party being better and more memorable than the last. But this is the first we've opened to the community, and looks set to be our biggest ever by far. I just hope the staff don't drink all the booze.</q></p>
<p>The Jagex team is also welcoming fancy dress and clan clothing for fans to get fully involved in what is set to be a RuneScape event that will go down in history.</p>
<p>All attendees will receive a goodie bag on entry, which will contain limited edition complementary RuneScape and RuneFest 2010 merchandise as well as an exclusive collectors' entry pass.</p>
<p>Tickets are available to all, however entry will be limited to over 16s only. There is a limit of four tickets per person as demand is so high. The entry tickets will be delivered electronically as the entry pass is a collectors' item.</p>
