<br/>
<br/>
<i>The UK's largest independent studio unveils its new free-to-play multiplayer strategy game - War of Legends</i></p>
<p><b>Cambridge, UK-19<sup>th</sup> January 2010</b> – Jagex Games Studio, the UK's largest independent games company, today announced the release of its first third-party developed game, War of Legends. The game, which will be joining Jagex's established portfolio of over 40 free-to-play games, will be available to play from today and players eager to find out more can register for free at <a href="http://www.waroflegends.com/">www.waroflegends.com</a>.</p>
<p>War of Legends is a real-time strategy game based on Chinese myth law; living out the ancient legend, players either pledge their support to the incumbent, unscrupulous and merciless King or his valiant, righteous, yet unproven contender. Players will be required to rule empires, manage resources, and command vast armies to conquer their enemies, whilst attempting to defend their wealthy cities against similarly experienced armies in a bid to gain ultimate supremacy.</p>
<p>War of Legends has a continuously evolving storyline with regular game updates, new tasks and in game items to keep players captivated. War of Legends features a persistent game world that continues to play out even when players are offline, allowing their armies to gain in strength and additional resources that will await them upon their return. As players build their empires they are quickly encouraged to form alliances with other players around the world to collaborate on the legendary quest for eternal glory.</p>
<p>War of Legends will naturally appeal to gamers with an interest in real-time strategy, tactical and management games, and with Jagex's assistance players are guaranteed an engaging, attractive and ultimately compelling gaming experience that is completely accessible to all.</p>
<p>War of Legends is the first third-party title to be published by Jagex Games Studio. The game is also the first Flash game from Jagex and, like all Jagex games, requires no downloads, is playable in the browser and is accessible on almost any computer with an internet connection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we started to develop games in 2001 we were forced to self-publish as none of the ‘traditional publishers' seemed interested in or even understood online game publishing. Nearly a decade and a great deal of success later, we want to leverage our experience and global reach to help other talented young developers bring their games to life” said Mark Gerhard, CEO at Jagex. “We were approached by the War of Legends development team last year, we played it and loved it, we believe our players would probably feel the same way so it's only natural to add it to our growing catalogue of games on Jagex.com. We are actively recruiting to help scale up our publishing division throughout 2010 and we are confident that WarofLegends.com will be the first of many great third-party games to be published by Jagex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>War of Legends is available to play for free today at <a href="http://www.waroflegends.com/">www.waroflegends.com</a>.</p>
