<br/>
<br/>
<i>Jagex announce plans for the UK's first ever live player event for RuneScape players</i></p>
<p><b>Cambridge, UK &mdash; Monday 26<sup>th</sup> April 2010</b> &mdash; <a href="../../index.html">Jagex Games Studio</a>, the UK’s largest independent games company, today announced its plans for the biggest ever player event for the massive RuneScape community – <b>RuneFest 2010</b>. RuneFest 2010 will be the first ever real-world player event of its size in the UK or for the company. Taking place on Saturday 28<sup>th</sup> August 2010 the event will be held at a very exciting central London venue.</p>
<p>The event has been designed to celebrate the worldwide RuneScape community with various aspects of the RuneScape universe brought to life, including themed areas for players to experience real-world RuneScape activities.</p>
<p>Players will also be privy to an exclusive gameplay experience onsite that will be like nothing experienced before or again outside the RuneFest walls.</p>
<p>Jagex is holding the event as a celebration to thank the millions and millions of dedicated RuneScape players around the world and as a way of personally interacting with thousands of them in real-life. The Lead developer and co-founder of Jagex Games Studio, Andrew Gower, said of the reasons for creating this event; "I've always wanted to go to an event like this, but I realised the only way that was going to happen was if we put it on ourselves. So we are."</p>
<p>Mark Gerhard, CEO of Jagex, commented; "The team is absolutely electric with enthusiasm for this event, we've always wanted to do a fan celebration for our players but crucially not just any old player convention – we insisted that it would be something that was not only different from tired conventions, but an intimate, memorable and naturally incredibly fun, festive fan celebration. This is certainly going to be a landmark event and one of the best parties we've ever had. The team and I are really excited about meeting and celebrating our biggest fans namely our epic community, we have also got a few surprises up our sleeve that I’m certain our players will love."</p>
<p>Attendees will be fully immersed into the RuneFest 2010 experience with involvement in all areas of the event, from upcoming competition winners being offered the opportunity to present at the Insider sessions, to winning players' art and video work being displayed in various competitions during the event.</p>
<p>Andrew Gower and the RuneScape development team will attend the event and will be taking part in many of the live events planned and they are all extremely excited about the prospect of meeting so many of the avid RuneScape players who have been playing RuneScape over the years.</p>
<p>Tickets for this event will go on sale later this month, although players are encouraged to register as soon as possible for pre-sale tickets, which will be available 24-hours before the main lines open to the public, in order to cope with the expected demand. Pre-registration opens today at <a href="http://www.runefest.com/" target="_blank">www.runefest.com</a></p>
<p>Full details of the event and pre-registration can be found at <a href="http://www.runefest.com/" target="_blank">www.runefest.com</a></p>
